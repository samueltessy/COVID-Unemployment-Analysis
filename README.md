## Project Description
The COVID-19 epidemic has significantly disrupted economies worldwide, leading to unprecedented challenges in the labor market and employment landscape (Sharma, A., Somanathan, R., Rohini, P., 2021). This research aims to understand the impact of the pandemic on unemployment rates and the subsequent recovery process by analyzing monthly unemployment data in India from January 2018 to February 2023. The project seeks to identify shifts in unemployment rates, examine sector-specific impacts, assess demographic disparities, and forecast future unemployment trends.

## Aim
The aim of this research is to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on the Indian labor market, explore emerging unemployment trends, and generate insights to inform policy measures for a resilient and inclusive labor market. Historical data analysis will be integrated with forecasting tools to achieve these objectives.

## Objectives
1. Investigate variations in India's unemployment rates pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and post-pandemic.
2. Examine sector-specific impacts on unemployment.
3. Analyze demographic disparities in job losses.
4. Determine factors influencing changes in unemployment rates.
5. Utilize time series analysis to forecast future unemployment trends.

## Evaluation Plan
The evaluation will employ qualitative and statistical tests to assess data collection, preprocessing, analysis efficacy, and model prediction accuracy. Statistical tests such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared will quantify model performance. Qualitative techniques including expert reviews will interpret results and their implications for labor market policies.

## Course Specific Learning Outcomes
- Apply AI techniques for data preprocessing, descriptive and inferential analysis, and time series analysis.
- Produce descriptive and inferential statements considering uncertainty, data quality, and model fitness.
- Process and interpret data from various sources using appropriate tools and languages like Python and R.
- Develop AI solutions adhering to software engineering principles, emphasizing code reuse, modularity, testing, and documentation.
